// The room code is a weak secret. Its number is a public nameplate the
// server finds the room by; only its two words are secret, 65,536
// combinations (16 bits), small enough to guess offline if they ever
// leaked in a form an attacker could test against. PAKE
// (password-authenticated key exchange) turns the code into a strong
// shared key without putting it — or anything derived from it that could
// be attacked offline — on the wire.
//
// What this buys us concretely:
//
//   - The rendezvous server is not a trusted party. It is the server that
//     tells the receiver "the sender is peer X"; if it lied and named one
//     of its own peers instead, the receiver used to connect to the
//     impostor and accept whatever files it offered. Now the impostor has
//     to know the code to complete the handshake. The server only ever
//     sees the nameplate, so it would have to guess the words — one guess
//     per attempt, each failure visible to the person it was tried on.
//   - A passive listener on either link learns nothing it can test codes
//     against.
//   - The exchange binds both peer IDs into the session key, so an attacker
//     cannot sit in the middle and pass the two sides' messages through to
//     each other: the two ends would derive different keys and the
//     confirmation step below would fail.
//
// What it does not buy: protection from someone who guesses the words
// outright. Every guess costs a full handshake with a live sender, and a
// sender closes its room after a few wrong ones (see p2p.Node), so the odds
// are a few in 65,536 per room — but they are not zero.
//
// On the choice of library: schollz/pake is a SPAKE2-style exchange of its
// own design, not RFC 9382 SPAKE2 or CPace, and has had far less review
// than either. It is what croc has used in production for years, and the
// parts that carry the weight here — binding both identities, and the
// mutual confirmation tags below — are ours and do not depend on its
// details. Moving to a standard construction when a maintained Go
// implementation exists is a change to this file and the protocol
// version, nothing else.
